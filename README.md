# ActionServerExample
An example action server and client that gives a boolean reponse as to whether the gripper is open or closed. Uses a .action file rather than a .srv file. Both the request and the reponse are booleans - server simply sends back a response that is the same as the request. Practice program leading up to the use of the URX robot in the 574 lab at Tufts University 2019.
